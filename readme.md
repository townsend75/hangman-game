## How to play

The computer selects a random word from a list. The number of letters in the word is then displayed as blanks( dashes), allowing the user to see the number of letters in the word. 
The player is then asked to guess a letter. If the letter appears in the word, either once or multiple times, the blanks are replaced by the guessed letter(s) in the correct position. If the guessed letter is not in the word, the number of tries is reduced by one. 
At any time, the player can also try to guess the complete word. If they are wrong, they lose one try and continue the game. 

The player wins if they can guess the word within the allotted number of tries.
